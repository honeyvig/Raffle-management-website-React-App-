1st stage:
Responsible website allowing users to register / sign in (with Google Account also) and create their own raffles and share it then as http links to a frontend website with their friends. In the admin panel, the users could then see list of reservations of the tickets, approve / decline those, edit the status of the raffle and draw random numbers from the tickets range.

Raffle would be defined just by there parameters:
Name
Description (html editor)
Number of tickets
Link (link to the frontend of the raffle generated by the system from the raffle name and some ID)
Status (New / Live / Closed)

No price of the tickets, no prizes to be won. It to be just tool for management of the tickets bookings.

User will then copy the link to the raffle frontend and share it with friends outside the app. In Whatsapp and Messenger, when sharing the link, fixed picture and fixed short description would be shown together with the link.  In the description the name of the user – creator – would be named like: Username is sharing his raffle with you.

Frontend view:
People who receive the link will see the responsive design of the raffle tickets available and also taken (please, see attached design sketches for better idea), are able to pick one or more numbers and reserve them to their name and email / mobile phone (simple text fields).

Then in admin panel:
User who created the raffle can see who reserved which numbers and can accept / decline the reservations one by one or also „Accept all“. Can also see summary, how many tickets are reserved already and how many are still available. When the user wil decide, can change the status of the raffle. When switching it to Closed status, instead of the raffle on the frontend, HTML message will be shown on the raffle link.

In the admin, there will be also button to generate random ticket number from the tickets range. No special animation, just simple random number will appear on click. User can generate the random number as many times he wishes and each of such is stored in the admin - one next to the other.

This first stage will be just running in the web browsers, mostly in mobile phones = the design must be responsive. React prefered, but not a condition.

The 2nd stage of the project will after few weeks of some testing, very likely, be the same, but as React App for mobile phones (iOs and Android), with option to charge small fee for each raffle created before the raffle goes live. Fees charged by Stripe or by both app stores?!

Please, give us separate prices for the 1st stage with website only and then separately for the React app also (just the admin would need the app and people booking the raffle tickets would not need it). Honestly – we have no experience with react development, so if it does not make sense to split the project into 2 phases, just make it one.

Do not hesitate to ask us whatever you'll need.
----------
It sounds like you're planning a fairly intricate system for managing raffles with several features, such as user authentication, ticket reservations, admin controls, and raffle creation. Below is a high-level breakdown of the ReactJS code and steps for building this system, split into the 1st stage (website) and the 2nd stage (mobile app). I'll also touch on the general requirements for each stage to help guide the development process.
Stage 1: Website Only (ReactJS)

For the first stage, we will build a responsive web application using ReactJS, incorporating the following main functionalities:
Core Functionalities

    User Authentication:
        Google Authentication (OAuth) and basic email/password sign-in/sign-up flow.
        Firebase Authentication or Auth0 can be used for Google login and user management.

    Raffle Creation:
        Allow users to create raffles by providing parameters like:
            Name
            Description (using a simple WYSIWYG HTML editor)
            Number of tickets (range, e.g., 1 to 1000)
            Status (New, Live, Closed)
            A unique URL (generated dynamically with name and ID)

    Frontend Raffle View:
        Responsive design to display available and reserved tickets.
        Users can pick one or more tickets and reserve them by providing their name, email, and/or mobile phone.

    Admin Panel:
        Admins can manage raffles by viewing a list of reservations.
        They can approve/decline individual reservations or use the Accept All option.
        Admins can change raffle status (New, Live, Closed).
        Random Number Generation for drawing winning ticket numbers from the reserved tickets.
        Display the number of reserved tickets and the remaining available tickets.

    Social Sharing:
        When a user shares a raffle link, the system will ensure that a preview image and a description (including the username of the raffle creator) appear in social media apps like WhatsApp and Messenger.

Technologies & Tools

    ReactJS for the frontend.
    Firebase or Auth0 for authentication.
    React Router for navigation.
    Axios or Fetch API for backend requests.
    Node.js/Express or any other backend framework for server-side logic (handling ticket reservations, status updates, etc.).
    Database: MongoDB or Firebase Firestore for storing raffle data, user information, reservations, and ticket states.
    Frontend Libraries:
        React Query for fetching and caching data.
        React Bootstrap or TailwindCSS for responsive UI.
        React Rich Text Editor (such as react-quill) for HTML description.
        React Social Sharing libraries for link preview setup.

Stage 1 Timeline & Cost Estimation (Website Only):

    Authentication & User Management: 2-3 weeks
    Raffle Creation and Management: 3-4 weeks
    Frontend (Responsive) Development: 2-3 weeks
    Admin Panel: 2-3 weeks
    Social Sharing and Preview: 1-2 weeks
    Testing and Debugging: 1-2 weeks

Estimated cost for Stage 1 (Website only): $5,000 - $8,000 depending on complexity and the hourly rates of the developers.
Stage 2: Mobile App (React Native)

For the second stage, you plan to transition the admin panel to a React Native mobile app (iOS and Android) with Stripe integration for payment handling. The user-facing parts (raffle booking) would remain web-based.
Core Functionalities for Admin Mobile App

    Admin Management:
        Admin will log in using the same authentication.
        Access the list of raffles with reservations and manage the reservations (approve/decline, accept all).
        Draw random winning ticket numbers and view results.
        Change the raffle status (New, Live, Closed).

    Stripe Integration:
        Admin can set a fee for creating a raffle before it goes live.
        Payments will be processed using Stripe (mobile version for both iOS and Android).
        Integration with App Store/Play Store for in-app purchases if needed.

Technologies & Tools

    React Native for the mobile app development.
    Stripe SDK for payment handling.
    Firebase/Firestore (same database as website) for syncing raffle data.
    React Navigation for app navigation.
    Expo or native build for deployment.

Stage 2 Timeline & Cost Estimation (Mobile App):

    Admin Panel Development: 3-4 weeks
    Stripe Payment Integration: 2 weeks
    Mobile App Testing: 2-3 weeks
    App Store/Play Store Deployment: 2-3 weeks
    React Native optimizations and debug: 1-2 weeks

Estimated cost for Stage 2 (Mobile app): $8,000 - $12,000 depending on complexity and testing needs.
Combined Solution (Website + Mobile App)

If you'd like to combine both the web and mobile app development into one comprehensive project, the development will span approximately 2-3 months depending on the team size and available resources.
Total Estimated Cost (Website + Mobile App): $12,000 - $18,000.
Key Considerations:

    Payment Integration: For the mobile app, integrating Stripe for charging small fees could become more complex depending on whether you plan to charge before the raffle goes live.
    Performance: The system should be designed to be responsive and scalable, especially if the number of users increases.
    Security: Proper security measures need to be implemented, especially for user authentication and data management (e.g., using JWT tokens, encrypted user data).

Conclusion:

Based on your requirements, splitting the project into two stages (website first and mobile app second) makes sense from both a development and testing perspective. The website can be the initial platform to gather user feedback, and the mobile app can be built later once you have validated the system.
